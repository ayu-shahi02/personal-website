          This study examines the impact of gender norms and work-family policies on the motherhood penalty across a large sample of developing countries. I find that ancestral adoption of the plough created cultural norms reducing women's labor force participation, with especially pronounced effects for mothers. A difference-in-differences analysis shows mixed results for gender-equal laws, though paid maternity leave demonstrates significant long-term employment benefits.

          The introduction of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in 2016 transformed the digital payments landscape in India. Using district-level variation in UPI adoption timing, we employed difference-in-differences methodology and found that earlier-adopting districts experienced lower economic crime (robbery, burglary) but no change in non-economic crimes, suggesting decreased cash availability as a mechanism.

          Absence of biological parents is expected to negatively impact their orphaned children's health outcomes through channels of depressed household incomes. Our comparative analysis examined stunting, wasting, and malnutrition across paternal orphans, maternal orphans, and double orphans versus non-orphans. Results showed orphans generally experienced disadvantages, though double orphans performed comparably in certain contexts.

          I hypothesize that internet-related foreign aid increases governmental capacity to control internet access, which authoritarian regimes exploit for censorship purposes, while offering limited evidence for improved freedom outcomes across recipient countries.
