        This thesis examines gender norms, work-family policies, and the motherhood penalty in developing nations.
        Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys, the study employs instrumental variable analysis and a
        staggered difference-in-differences approach to investigate how cultural and institutional factors
        shape the economic costs of parenthood, with particular focus on mothers in developing economies.

        This paper examines the relationship between Unified Payments Interface (UPI) adoption and economic crime
        in Indian districts. We investigate whether the shift toward digital payments reduces opportunities for
        certain types of crime by altering the transaction landscape and reducing the prevalence of cash-based exchanges.
